This release features Network Light, a UPnP-enabled software-based light bulb
that provides Switch Power and Dimming services, as defined by UPnP forum as
'DimmableLight v1.0". It is mainly intended to be a simple example of a UPnP
device based on GUPnP, and a demonstration of simplistic yet powerful GUPnP
API. It can also be used to debug generic and DimmableLight control points.

Changes to Universal Control Point in this release:

- Use of gtk stock icons wherever appropriate.
- New cool icons from Lapo Calamandrei, licensed under GPL
- Use icon from the Device, if available, to represent it.
- Subscribe to services, by default.
- Ability to copy&paste details and events.
